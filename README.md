# Tatry_guide
This is a project of a navigator using the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest route between two selected places in the Tatra Mountains.

## Find your destination

This program to find the shortest path between two places, uses the dijkstra algorithm, ensuring the optimal solution. The distribution of points on the map is described by a non-directed graph, where individual vertices represent individual places on the map, and the weight matrix contains real (expressed in meters) distances between places. So far, I have added about 160 points (you can find them in graph_map/CLvertices_list), representing popular mountain peaks, lakes, passes or trails in the Tatra Mountains. In the future, I plan to extend the area to the entire Polish Tatra Mountains.

Here you can see how my program works, enjoy!
